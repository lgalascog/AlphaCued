## Eyelink Wrappers

A collection of functions to make interacting with the Eyelink 1000+ 
during the experiment more straight-forward.
All of these functions require the Eyelink C API included in SR-Research's
developer pack.

### Matlab functions

Just add the directory to your path and call the .m-functions from within
your Psychtoolbox script.

### Python functions

Place EyelinkWrapper.py and EyeLinkCoreGraphicsPsychoPy.py in your working directory.
import the EyelinkWrapper module at the top of your Psychopy script.
